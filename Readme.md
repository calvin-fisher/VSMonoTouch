# MonoTouch for Visual Studio 2012

## About
The vs2012 branch contains a modified version of the [VsMonoTouch extension](https://github.com/follesoe/VSMonoTouch) that runs on Visual Studio 2012.

Actually, the current status is ["Works on My Machine"](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html), because I needed a (particulary) quick and dirty solution.<br/>
Just feel free to apply any changes if reguired to make it works on your machine :)

Just go to the page of the original extension for further information: [https://github.com/follesoe/VSMonoTouch](https://github.com/follesoe/VSMonoTouch)
